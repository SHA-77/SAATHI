A program that enables people to explore opportunities available to them at any point of their they are in.
Many people at some point in their lives may face the daunting task of figuring out what they want to do with their lives. Some individuals may have a specific goal in mind but lack the knowledge of how to achieve it, while others may have a general idea of their interests but are uncertain about how to turn those interests into a career. Unfortunately, some individuals may not even know where to begin when it comes to choosing a career path.
To address this common problem, our program is designed to create a comprehensive database of all career options, colleges, and courses offered by them. We aim to provide detailed information about the qualifications required for different jobs and colleges, as well as the exams needed to achieve them. By collating this information in one place, we can provide users with a roadmap to reach their goals.

For the first two types of users - those with a clear goal or a general idea of their interests - we will take their current qualifications and interests into account. Using this information, we can provide them with tailored advice on what steps they need to take to achieve their goals. Whether it's information on colleges, courses, or job opportunities, we will provide users with the necessary guidance to help them make informed decisions.
For the third type of user - those who are uncertain about what they want to do - we will ask questions about their interests, hobbies, and personality. By analyzing their responses, we can suggest suitable career opportunities that align with their unique qualities. Our program aims to provide a holistic approach to career counseling by taking into account the individual's personality, interests, and qualifications, making it easier for users to make informed decisions about their future.
